https://github.com/ehsan-mohammadi/Aim-IK
-This source was interesting to me because in the future when I need to make games I need to know how to make my character face the direction I want them looking. This is more for aim and direction use.

- I thought that this one was interesting because when making a game you need the correct colors, motions, graphics, but you also need to include sound in a game.

https://github.com/markashleybell/MAB.DotIgnore
- When I was looking for a gitignore I was interested in this one because this ignore would implement the same file matching behavior to determine which file to ignore when adding a commit.
